Coding Style
------------

-  Your code should be self-documenting. Comments should be for
   describing *why* you are doing something. If you feel you need
   a comment to explain *what* you are doing, the code
   could probably be rewritten more clearly.
-  We use `Black <https://github.com/psf/black>`__ style.
-  Use builtin plugins of your IDE or the `black -l 120 .` command to validate your code style.
-  Docstrings are required for all modules, classes, attributes, methods and
   functions. Docstrings should follow the
   `Google Python Style Guide <http://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html?showone=Comments#38-comments-and-docstrings>`__
   for consistency.
