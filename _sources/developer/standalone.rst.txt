KLayout Standalone Usage
========================

The :ref:`developer_setup` or :ref:`salt_package` sections described setting up KQCircuits for use
with KLayout Editor (GUI). However, KQC can also be used without KLayout
Editor by using the standalone KLayout Python module. This lets you develop
and use KQCircuits completely within any Python development environment of
your choice, without running KLayout GUI. For example, any debugger can then
be used and automated tests can be performed. The KQCircuits elements can
also be visualized using any suitable viewer or library during development.

Prerequisites
-------------

If you want to run KQCircuits outside of the KLayout Editor, you will need
Python 3 and ``pip`` installed.

Successfully tested with

- Python 3.7.6, 3.8.5, 3.10.12

Older versions of klayout (<0.28) do not support certain new features of
KQCircuits. If you want to use older klayout you may need to check out a
suitable older version of KQCircuits too. API changes of klayout are backwards
compatible so you are safe using older KQCircuits versions with the latest
KLayout.

Installation
-------------

Set up a Python virtual environment, "venv".

If you have not yet done so, ``git clone`` the KQCircuits source code from
https://github.com/iqm-finland/KQCircuits to a location of your choice.

This section explains how to install KQC in "development mode", so that a
link to your local KQC repo is added to the python environment. When using
KQC installed in this way, the version in your local repo is thus used.

Standard, Not Secure Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To do this, activate your python environment and write in command prompt /
terminal:

.. code-block:: console

    python -m pip install -e klayout_package/python

The previous command installs only the packages which are always required
when using KQC. Other packages may be required for specific purposes, and
these can be installed by using instead a command like:

.. code-block:: console

    python -m pip install -e "klayout_package/python[docs,tests,notebooks,simulations]"

You can choose for which purposes you want to install the requirements by
modifying the text in the square brackets. Note that there should not be any
spaces within the brackets.

Reproducible, Secure Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is just like the standard installation but with pinned and hashed
dependencies resulting in a more secure and reproducible environment. You'll
need ``pip-tools`` installed for this.

First install KQCircuits' dependencies and any other set of requirements you
may need. This needs to be done only once per venv at initial setup time or
when any of the used ``*requirements.txt`` files change. In this example we
only install KQCircuits', documentation building's and pytest's dependencies:

.. code-block:: console

    cd klayout_package/python
    pip-sync requirements.txt doc-requirements.txt test-requirements.txt

Note the other ``*requirement.txt`` files in this folder. Any combination of them
is allowed but KQCircuits' requirements  (``requirements.txt``) are always needed.

Also note the OS-prefixes, ``win-`` or ``mac-``, you are supposed to use these
when running on Windows or Mac. The prefixless files are for Linux and also for
other platforms when the platform specific version is not present.

Finally install KQCircuits itself in editable mode and without dependencies, as
they are already present:

.. code-block:: console

    pip install --no-deps -e .

or from the top level:

.. code-block:: console

    pip install --no-deps -e klayout_package/python/

PyPI Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you do not need all KQCircuits sources but only the core KQC classes you may simply run ``pip
install kqcircuits`` to get the Python package only. You can use this the same way as the full
developer installation but remember that scripts, masks, documentation and notebooks are not part of
the Python package. A new Python package is automatically uploaded to PyPI for every tagged commit
in GitHub.

The ``kqcircuits`` Python package may be used with an independently downloaded KQCircuits source
directory to run tests, simulation scripts or build documentation or masks from there. You are
supposed to run most of these from the source directory or you may need to specify the
``KQC_ROOT_PATH`` environment variable so that ``kqcircuits`` finds the sources.

Usage
-----

The independence from KLayout GUI makes it possible to do all development of
KQCircuits fully within a Python IDE of your choice. For example, standalone
debuggers and automated testing (see :ref:`testing`) can be done, which would
not be possible without the standalone KLayout module.

It is possible to generate masks, run simulation scripts or even the actual simulations on the
command line:

.. code-block:: console

    python klayout_package/python/scripts/masks/quick_demo.py
    python klayout_package/python/scripts/simulations/double_pads_sim.py -q
    kqc sim waveguides_sim_compare.py -q

The output of the above commands will be in the automatically created ``tmp`` directory. If you
desire the outputs elsewhere set the ``KQC_TMP_PATH`` environment variable to some other path.

The preferred way to instantiate a drawing environment in standalone mode is with the :class:`.KLayoutView` object::

    from kqcircuits.klayout_view import KLayoutView
    view = KLayoutView()

This creates the required object structure and has helper methods for inserting cells and exporting images. See the
:class:`.KLayoutView` API documentation for more details.

  .. note::
    The user **must** keep a reference to the :class:`.KLayoutView` instance in scope, as long as references to the layout or
    individual cells are used.

Jupyter notebook usage
----------------------

There is an example Jupyter notebook `KQCircuits-Examples/notebooks/viewer.ipynb <https://github.com/iqm-finland/KQCircuits-Examples/blob/main/notebooks/viewer.ipynb>`__ in the notebooks
folder, which shows how to create and visualize KQCircuits elements with the
standalone KLayout module. Run it like:

.. code-block:: console

    jupyter-notebook notebooks/viewer.ipynb


Updating the required dependencies
----------------------------------

Don't do it unless absolutely necessary! The security model (TOFU) works best if
dependencies are rarely changed. When updating dependencies try to verify that
the new versions are legitimate.

Edit the ``*requirements.in`` files according to your needs. Try to keep >=, <=
and == version constraints to a minimum. Try to improve other dependencies too,
not only the ones your need.

Compile the new ``*requirements.txt`` files:

.. code-block:: console

    pip-compile --generate-hashes requirements.in > requirements.txt
    pip-compile --generate-hashes doc-requirements.in > doc-requirements.txt
    [...]

You'll need to compile the Windows and Mac versions too. If they are different
from the common (Linux) versions then remember to commit those files too.
