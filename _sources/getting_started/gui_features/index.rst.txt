GUI Features
============

The GUI usage of KQCircuits is mostly the same as in KLayout without KQCircuits,
so it is recommended to read the section `KLayout Basics <https://www.klayout.de/doc-qt5/manual/basic.html>`_ of the
KLayout documentation. It explains for example cell hierarchy and other important concepts. In this section we explain
KQCircuits-specific GUI features and highlight some useful features of the KLayout GUI.
