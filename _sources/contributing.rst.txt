Versioning
^^^^^^^^^^

KQCircuits follows PEP 440 version scheme as implemented by `miniver
<https://github.com/jbweston/miniver>`_: ``<public version identifier>[+<local version label>]``.
The public version identifier needs to be set by ``git tag -a`` to ``v<major>.<minor>.<micro>``
whenever needed by bumping the appropriate version level:

* major when making a new official release
* minor when making a new Salt package
* micro when making any *incompatible change*

By *incompatible change* we mean one or more of these:

* backwards-incompatible API change
* any change that could break the code of other users
* API addition needed by code using KQC
* serious non-cosmetic geometry change that affects functionality
