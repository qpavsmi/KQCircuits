=====

KQCircuits development was started by Johannes Heinsoo at Aalto University. The
`final KQC version developed at Aalto <https://research.aalto.fi/en/publications
/aalto-university-kqcircuits-aalto-university-software-package-and>`__
corresponds to the `v0.0.0 tag in the IQM GitHub repository <https://github
.com/iqm-finland/KQCircuits/releases/tag/v0.0.0>`__. Since then, KQCircuits
has been developed by IQM. See the :ref:`authors` section for other authors.
