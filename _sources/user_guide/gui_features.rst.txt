GUI Features
============

The GUI usage of KQCircuits is mostly the same as in KLayout without KQCircuits,
so it is recommended to read the section `KLayout Basics <https://www.klayout.de/doc-qt5/manual/basic.html>`_ of the
KLayout documentation. It explains for example cell hierarchy and other important concepts. In this section we explain
KQCircuits-specific GUI features and highlight some useful features of the KLayout GUI.

Useful hotkeys
--------------

Use the following hotkeys to navigate around, and if not all parts of the geometry are visible:

- ``*`` makes the full cell hierarchy visible. Otherwise only cell frames may be
  visible. Also accessible from *Display* -> *Full hierarchy* in the top menu.
- ``F2`` zooms to show the full layout (from the current top cell)
- ``Shift+F2`` zooms to show the currently selected cell

Introduction to Elements
------------------------

KQCircuits provides a collection of ``Elements``, which are building blocks for creating complex designs. The elements
are grouped into several **Libraries**, including the following:

- The ``Element Library`` contains basic elements such as waveguides, capacitors and connectors
- The ``Qubit Library`` contains qubit shapes
- The ``Chip Library`` contains example chip designs, which are also elements

Internally, elements are built on the KLayout concept of PCells, short for *parametric cells*. Each element has a set of
parameters, which can be changed to modify the shape or other features.

An important concept in KLayout is the distinction between cells and instances. When you place an element, KLayout first
generates the corresponding PCell, and then places an **Instance** of that PCell in the current top cell. There can be
multiple instances of the same cell, each with the exact same geometry but different location, size and magnification.

In most cases, you want to work with cell instances. This can be done in the main panel, for example clicking an
element with the *Select* tool selects the corresponding cell instance.

PCells can internally include other PCells, and many KQC elements consist of other elements. This creates a hierarchy
of cells in KLayout. The cell hierarchy is visible in KLayout in the **Cells** toolbox. To choose which cell is shown as
**Top cell** in the main window, right-click a cell and select *Show As New Top*. The top cell is shown in bold.

Placing Elements
----------------

There are two ways to insert an ``Element`` into the layout:

#. dragging from **Libraries** toolbox

#. using "instance" tool from the toolbar

Either of these will generate the corresponding **PCell** and allows you to place an **Instance** of the PCell in
If the corresponding **PCell instance** does not yet exist, corresponding code from the KQC library is evoked.

Here is an animation demonstrating dragging from the **Libraries** toolbox

Modifying Element parameters
----------------------------

If an ``Element`` is in the layout, one can change its **parameters** by double clicking the ``Element`` which brings up
the **Object properties** window. In the window there is a **PCell parameters** tab, where parameters can be changed.

.. image:: ../images/gui_workflows/modifying_pcell.gif

Note that there are a few situations where the *Object properties* window doesn't appear when double clicking:

* The ``Element`` is inside another PCell. One can only change parameters of the top level Element. If one desires to
  change parameters of the sub-elements, the top level element should be turned static before by selecting the top
  level element and clicking *Edit* -> *Selection* -> *Convert To Static Cell*. Then, the cell can be set as new top
  in the Cells toolbox.
* Once an ``Element`` is converted to a static cell, the parameters can no longer be changed.
* Some elements have guiding shapes such as boxes or paths, which take priority in selection. To avoid selecting these
  by accident, one can disable each type under *Edit* -> *Select*.

.. _modifying_waveguides:

Modifying waveguides
--------------------

For some elements, the shape can be edited directly in the GUI. For example, ``Waveguide Coplanar``,
``Waveguide Composite`` and ``Spiral Resonator Polygon`` have paths that can be edited with the **Partial** tool.

The following operations are supported:

* Drag a node to move it, or click to select, move, click to confirm.
* Double click on an edge to create an additional node.
* Click to select a node and press the ``Del`` key to delete a node.
* Drag edges to shift the edge; the neighboring nodes adjust to keep the path connected.

The following video shows these operations for a waveguide:

.. image:: ../images/gui_workflows/modifying_waveguide.gif

If the GUI paths are not visible, make sure that the option *Show PCell guiding and error shapes* is enabled under
*Display* -> *Cells* in the KLayout setup.

Editing WaveguideComposite Nodes
--------------------------------

``Waveguide Composite`` is a very flexible element, that can be used to route complex waveguides. It can include other
elements that are automatically connected correctly inline with the waveguide, can insert meandering segments to
meet a specific waveguide length, and can include airbridge crossings or flip-chip connectors to route signals in a
3D integrated design.

A ``Waveguide Composite`` can be inserted like any other element, and the path it follows can be edited with the
*Partial* tool like other waveguides, as described above. However, to edit the advanced properties of each individual
``Node``, use the ``Edit Node`` tool in the toolbar.

With ``Edit Node`` selected, click on any node to bring up the ``Edit Node`` dialog. The currently selected node is
highlighted by a dashed rectangle. Note that only waveguide nodes that are directly under the current top cell can be
edited, and only ``Waveguide Composite`` nodes.

In the ``Edit Node`` dialog box, the position, length, and other properties can be edited. Changes are updated when
*Apply* is clicked. If an inline element is chosen, the element's properties can be entered as ``key=value`` pairs, each
on a separate line. See the API documentation for the PCell parameters supported by each element.

The following video shows the workflow with the ``Edit Node`` tool:

Converting elements placed in GUI into code
-------------------------------------------

KQCircuits includes a macro :git_url:`export_cells_as_code.lym <klayout_package/python/scripts/macros/export/export_cells_as_code.lym>` that can be used to
convert elements placed in GUI into code that can be used in chip PCells. For
more information, see the docstring and comments in the macro. The following
animation demonstrates how a chip is modified by placing elements in the GUI
and how to use this macro to include those elements in PCell generation code:

.. image:: ../images/gui_workflows/converting_gui_elements_to_code.gif

The macro has special handling for waveguides (of :class:`.WaveguideCoplanar` type).
The code generated for them automatically detects nearby reference points of
other elements, and uses these instead of hardcoded points as the positions
of the waveguide nodes. See the :ref:`modifying_waveguides` section above for
instructions on how to modify :class:`.WaveguideCoplanar` in GUI.

In order to make waveguides connect "nicely" to ports of other elements, most
ports in KQC elements have an additional "corner refpoint". To connect a
waveguide to port "a" of instance "x", you  should generally place its first
two points at ``x_port_a`` and ``x_port_a_corner``. The corner point is not
needed if the next point would anyway be in the direction of
``x_port_a_corner``, since the purpose of the corner point is only to make
the direction of the first waveguide segment aligned with the port.


Useful Menu Commands
--------------------

Several very useful macros are directly accessible from KLayout's "**KQCircuits**"
drop-down menu:

- **Fill with ground plane grid** -- Creates a ground plane grid covering the top cell bounding box,
  except the parts in grid avoidance layer. Requires at least one cell to exist in the current
  layout. Only creates the grid for "1t1"-face. Remember to unhide the 1t1_ground_grid layer to make it
  visible.

- **All chips in the library** -- Opens a new layout and puts all available chips there arranged in
  a grid. Note that this operation may take several minutes.

- **Empty layout with a top cell and default layers** -- A new layout in KLayout is empty and has no
  assigned layers by default. This macro helps to create a more useful new layout with a predefined
  top-cell and the default KQCircuits layers.

- **Reload libraries** -- Reloads KQCircuits code from storage making it possible to modify elements
  and see the change without having to restart KLayout and reload the edited elements. This is
  illustrated in the end of previous section's video. Note that this macro does
  not reload the KQCircuits :git_url:`defaults <klayout_package/python/kqcircuits/defaults.py>`
  file.

DRC scripts are accessible from KLayout's "**Tools -> DRC** drop-down menu:

- **Area and Density** -- Calculate area and density for everything in view, in every layer.
- **Waveguide** -- Detects Waveguides crossing anything in base_metal_gap_wo_grid layer.
