**KQCircuits** is a Python library developed by IQM for automating the design of
superconducting quantum circuits. It uses the `KLayout <https://klayout.de>`__
layout design program API.

KQCircuits was created to reduce the time and effort needed to design quantum
processors and to help avoid human errors in the design process. Defining the
circuits using code allows the geometry to be created in a consistent way, with
more precision than manual drawing. Using KQCircuits it is easy to instantly
generate multiple designs with different parameter values affecting the geometry
in complex ways. KQCircuits also enables the exchange of circuit element
definitions between quantum processor designers, making it easy to modify or
extend the elements designed by others.

KQCircuits generates multi-layer 2-dimensional-geometry representing common
structures in quantum processing units (QPU). It includes definitions of
parametrized geometrical objects or "elements", framework to easily define
your own elements, framework to get geometry from the elements by setting
values to parameters and a framework to assemble a full QPU design by combining
many of the elements in different geometrical relations. Among other
templates, are also structures to combine QPU designs to create optical mask
layout and EBL patterns for fabrication of quantum circuits and export a set
of files for a mask as needed for QPU fabrication.
